      <p> Every since I was little I've been fishing. This for sure is one of my fvorite things to do in the summer.
        In montana a huge part of living here is loving the envirment you're in. Fishing has really showed me what
        Montana truly has to offer. Fishing for me is my tranquility, and I couldn't imagine a Montana summer without it.</p>

      <p>
        Exploring truly i what I love to do so Montana doesn't act as the only state that I get that sense of
        adventure in. Arizona is my second home, and our favorite thing to do is explore on a side by side.
        the desert offers a huge contrast in senery to what we have here. Buying our side by sides was by far the best purchase we've made.

      <p> I play right into Montana stereo types.I ride a horse and I couldn't be anymore proud of that. My horse
        definetly controls my life. if there is a day where I even have to possibility of riding I'll be there.
        Most mornings before school i go to the stables we keep them at, and do chores. This ride was one of my favorites because the adventure
        behind it all made it so fun.
